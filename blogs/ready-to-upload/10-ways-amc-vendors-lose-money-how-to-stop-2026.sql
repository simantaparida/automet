  $$# 10 Ways AMC Vendors Lose Money (And How to Stop It) — 2026 Guide

If you're an AMC vendor in India—whether you service ACs, elevators, fire systems, or IT equipment—you already know this harsh truth:

**AMC contracts that look profitable on paper often turn into money pits.**

You signed a ₹2 lakh annual maintenance contract expecting 30% margins. Six months later, you've:
- Made 15 unplanned service visits (you budgeted for 8)
- Replaced ₹25,000 worth of spare parts (you budgeted ₹10,000)
- Spent 40 hours on-site (you priced for 24 hours)

**Final margin? 8%. Or worse: a loss.**

The good news? **Most profit leaks in AMC businesses are fixable** with better planning, tracking, and digital tools.

In this guide, we'll expose the **10 most common ways AMC vendors in India lose money**—and give you actionable solutions to plug each leak.

By the end, you'll have a roadmap to turn your AMC business from break-even (or loss-making) into a **consistent 25-35% margin operation.**

## Why AMC Profitability Is So Hard (The India Context)

Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMCs) are the backbone of many field service businesses in India:
- **HVAC contractors** manage AC maintenance for offices, hotels, hospitals
- **Elevator companies** service lifts in residential and commercial buildings
- **Fire & safety firms** maintain fire extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers
- **IT service providers** manage servers, networks, printers
- **Facility management** companies handle multi-service AMCs (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, cleaning)

### **The AMC Profit Paradox**

AMCs are supposed to provide **predictable recurring revenue.** But in reality:

❌ **Customers expect unlimited service** ("It's under AMC, come fix it!")
❌ **Scope creep is rampant** (Customer adds 5 new ACs mid-contract without price adjustment)
❌ **Vendors underprice to win contracts** (₹1,500/AC/year when the real cost is ₹2,200/AC/year)
❌ **No visibility into actual costs** (How much did you really spend on that ₹50,000 AMC?)

**Result:** You're working hard but not making money.

Let's break down the 10 specific ways money leaks out—and how to stop each one.

---

## **Money Leak #1: Underpricing AMC Contracts**

### **The Problem:**
You're competing with 5 other vendors for a corporate AMC. To win, you quote **₹1,200/AC/year** (competitor quoted ₹1,500).

**What you forgot to account for:**
- 4 preventive maintenance visits/year × 1 hour each × ₹400 technician cost = ₹1,600
- Spare parts (filters, gas top-ups): ₹600/year average
- **Total cost: ₹2,200/AC**

**Your quote: ₹1,200. Loss: ₹1,000/AC/year.**

With a 50-AC contract, you lose ₹50,000 annually.

### **The Fix:**

**Step 1: Calculate your true cost per asset**

| **Cost Component** | **Example (AC AMC)** |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Preventive maintenance visits (4/year × 1 hour × ₹400/hour) | ₹1,600 |
| Spare parts (avg. annual usage) | ₹600 |
| Travel (avg. per visit: ₹100 × 4 visits) | ₹400 |
| Overhead (10% of labor + parts) | ₹220 |
| **Total cost** | **₹2,820** |
| **Your target margin (30%)** | **₹1,206** |
| **Minimum quote price** | **₹4,026** |

**Step 2: Use tiered pricing**

Don't quote a flat rate. Offer 3 tiers:

| **Tier** | **Scope** | **Price/AC/Year** |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Basic** | 2 PM visits, no breakdown cover | ₹2,000 |
| **Standard** | 4 PM visits, breakdown cover (parts extra) | ₹3,500 |
| **Premium** | 4 PM visits, breakdown cover, parts included | ₹5,000 |

**Step 3: Build in escalation clauses**
- "Prices increase 5% annually to account for inflation."
- "If customer adds >10% more assets, pricing is renegotiated."

**Result:** You stop winning contracts at a loss.

---

## **Money Leak #2: Untracked Spare Parts Usage**

### **The Problem:**
Your technician replaces an AC compressor (₹18,000) on a ₹40,000 AMC contract.

**Who approved it? Was it covered under the AMC? Did you charge the customer?**

If you don't track parts usage per job, you:
- Don't know if the AMC is profitable
- Can't bill customers for out-of-scope parts
- Suffer "parts leakage" (technicians using stock without documentation)

**Example:** A facilities AMC vendor in Bangalore discovered they were losing ₹3.5 lakhs/year in untracked spare parts after implementing inventory tracking.

### **The Fix:**

**Step 1: Define what's included vs. excluded in AMC**

**Included (wear and tear):**
- AC filters, gas refills (up to 500g/year)
- Elevator door sensors, light bulbs
- Fire extinguisher refills

**Excluded (major failures):**
- Compressors, motors, circuit boards
- Elevator cables, control panels
- Fire alarm control units

**Document this in the AMC contract!**

**Step 2: Track every part used**

Use field service software (like Automet) to:
- Record parts used per job (technician selects from inventory)
- Tag parts as "AMC-covered" or "chargeable to customer"
- Auto-generate invoices for chargeable parts

**Step 3: Set usage thresholds**

"If a single part costs >₹5,000 or total parts/year exceed ₹X, customer pays."

**Result:** You stop bleeding parts costs and can charge customers fairly.

---

## **Money Leak #3: Missed Preventive Maintenance Visits**

### **The Problem:**
Your AMC contract includes 4 PM visits/year (every 3 months).

**What actually happens:**
- You remember to schedule Q1 and Q2 visits
- Q3 gets delayed by 6 weeks (team was busy with breakdowns)
- Q4 never happens (you forgot)

**Customer doesn't complain** (they're happy to save your time).

**But YOU lose:** Skipping PM visits leads to more breakdowns, which you must service under AMC—costing you 2-3× more than planned PM.

**Example:** An elevator AMC vendor skipped 30% of quarterly PM visits. Result: Emergency breakdowns doubled, profit margin dropped from 28% to 12%.

### **The Fix:**

**Step 1: Auto-schedule recurring jobs**

Use FSM software to create recurring jobs:
- "AC Preventive Maintenance - Client XYZ - Building A - Every 90 days"
- "Fire Extinguisher Inspection - Client ABC - Site 1 - Every 180 days"

**The system auto-creates the job 7 days before the due date.**

**Step 2: Send automated PM reminders**

- 7 days before: Email coordinator: "Upcoming PM due for Client XYZ on Feb 15"
- 3 days before: SMS customer: "Your quarterly AC maintenance is scheduled for Feb 15, 2-4 PM"
- 1 day after (if not completed): Alert to manager: "Overdue PM: Client XYZ"

**Step 3: Track PM completion rate**

**KPI:** (PM visits completed on time) / (Total scheduled PM visits) × 100

**Target:** 95%+

**Result:** You stop missing PM visits, reduce emergency breakdowns, and maintain profitability.

---

## **Money Leak #4: Inefficient Technician Scheduling**

### **The Problem:**
You have 3 AMC sites in Koramangala, Bangalore—but you send:
- Technician A from Whitefield (12 km away) on Monday
- Technician B from Indiranagar (8 km away) on Wednesday
- Technician C from Koramangala (on-site) on Friday

**Total distance:** 20+ km
**Total travel time:** 90 minutes
**Fuel cost:** ₹400

**If you'd clustered all 3 jobs with Technician C:**
- Distance: 3 km (same area)
- Travel time: 15 minutes
- Fuel cost: ₹50

**Waste:** ₹350 and 75 minutes per week.

Across 50 AMC sites, poor scheduling costs ₹18,000-₹25,000/month.

### **The Fix:**

**Step 1: Cluster jobs geographically**

Group AMC sites by area:
- **Zone 1 (Koramangala):** 8 sites → Technician C handles all
- **Zone 2 (Whitefield):** 6 sites → Technician A handles all
- **Zone 3 (Indiranagar):** 5 sites → Technician B handles all

**Step 2: Batch PM visits**

Instead of: "1 PM visit per site per month"

Do: "All Zone 1 PM visits on Week 1, all Zone 2 PM visits on Week 2, etc."

**Step 3: Use route optimization**

FSM software with route optimization suggests:
- Best order to visit 5 sites in one day
- Shortest driving distance
- Avoids U-turns and traffic hotspots

**Result:** You cut travel costs by 30-40% and complete 1-2 more jobs/day per technician.

---

## **Money Leak #5: Scope Creep Without Documentation**

### **The Problem:**
You signed an AMC for 20 ACs at a corporate office.

**6 months later:**
- Customer adds 5 new ACs (didn't inform you)
- Customer asks you to service the server room AC (not in original scope)
- Customer requests Saturday emergency visit (your AMC is Mon-Fri, 9-6)

**You comply** (to keep the customer happy).

**But you never:**
- Charged extra for the 5 new ACs
- Billed for the out-of-scope server room AC
- Invoiced for weekend emergency visit

**Loss:** ₹30,000-₹50,000 over the contract year.

### **The Fix:**

**Step 1: Asset registry in AMC contract**

Your AMC contract should include an **asset list:**

| **Asset ID** | **Type** | **Location** | **Serial Number** | **Included in AMC** |
|--------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| AC-01 | Split 1.5T | Cabin 1 | XYZ123 | ✅ |
| AC-02 | Window 1T | Cabin 2 | XYZ124 | ✅ |
| AC-03 | Cassette 3T | Hall | XYZ125 | ✅ |

**Total: 20 assets under AMC.**

"Any asset not listed is excluded. Customer must notify vendor in writing to add assets (pricing to be renegotiated)."

**Step 2: Track every job against an asset**

When a technician services an AC, the system asks:
- "Which asset is this for?"
- If the asset is **not in the AMC list**, flag it as **"Out of Scope"**
- Auto-generate a chargeable invoice

**Step 3: Define AMC coverage terms**

In the contract:
- **Coverage hours:** Mon-Fri, 9 AM - 6 PM
- **Emergency visits outside coverage:** ₹2,000/visit surcharge
- **Out-of-scope work:** Billed at ₹500/hour + parts

**Result:** You stop free work and can charge customers fairly for extras.

---

## **Money Leak #6: Manual Invoicing Delays**

### **The Problem:**
Your AMC is ₹1.2 lakh/year, payable quarterly (₹30,000 every 3 months).

**What happens:**
- March 31: Q4 invoice due
- April 15: You finally generate the invoice (2 weeks late)
- May 10: Customer pays (45 days after due date)

**You just gave the customer an interest-free loan of ₹30,000 for 45 days.**

Across 20 AMC clients, delayed invoicing costs ₹2-3 lakhs in working capital locked up.

### **The Fix:**

**Step 1: Auto-generate recurring invoices**

FSM software should auto-create invoices:
- "Generate ₹30,000 invoice for Client XYZ on March 31 (quarterly AMC payment)"
- Send via email + WhatsApp
- Set due date: April 15 (Net 15 terms)

**Step 2: Automated payment reminders**

- 7 days before due date: "Your AMC payment of ₹30,000 is due on April 15"
- On due date: "Reminder: Payment due today"
- 3 days overdue: "Your payment is overdue. Please settle by EOD to avoid service suspension."
- 10 days overdue: Escalate to manager + phone call

**Step 3: Online payment links**

Include Razorpay/PayU/Instamojo link in invoice:
- "Pay Now" button
- Customer clicks → pays via UPI/card → instant confirmation

**Result:** You get paid 15-20 days faster, improving cash flow and reducing follow-ups.

---

## **Money Leak #7: No Renewal Tracking (Contracts Expire Silently)**

### **The Problem:**
You signed a 1-year AMC with Client ABC on April 1, 2025.

**March 2026:** The contract expires.

**What you forgot to do:**
- Send renewal reminder 60 days before expiry
- Negotiate price increase (5-10% for inflation)
- Ask for feedback and upsell (add more assets)

**What happens instead:**
- Customer doesn't renew (they forgot too)
- You lose ₹80,000 annual recurring revenue
- Customer calls you 3 months later for a breakdown (you charge ad-hoc rates, but it's not an AMC)

**Industry stat:** 30-40% of AMC non-renewals happen because **vendors forgot to follow up.**

### **The Fix:**

**Step 1: Track AMC expiry dates**

Maintain a contract registry:

| **Client** | **AMC Value** | **Start Date** | **End Date** | **Renewal Status** |
|------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Client A | ₹1,20,000 | Apr 1, 2025 | Mar 31, 2026 | 🟡 Renewing (60 days) |
| Client B | ₹80,000 | Jan 1, 2025 | Dec 31, 2025 | 🔴 Expired |
| Client C | ₹2,50,000 | Jul 1, 2025 | Jun 30, 2026 | 🟢 Active |

**Step 2: Automated renewal reminders**

- **90 days before expiry:** Internal alert to sales: "Client A's AMC expires in 90 days. Start renewal discussions."
- **60 days before expiry:** Email customer: "Your AMC expires on Mar 31. Let's discuss renewal and any changes to scope."
- **30 days before expiry:** Send renewal quote (price + scope)
- **15 days before expiry:** Follow-up call: "Have you reviewed our renewal proposal?"
- **On expiry date (if not renewed):** "Your AMC has expired. Ad-hoc rates now apply."

**Step 3: Build renewal into your sales process**

Don't treat renewals as an afterthought. Assign a **Renewal Manager** (could be the same sales person or coordinator) to:
- Track upcoming renewals
- Conduct annual business reviews (ABR) with key clients 90 days before expiry
- Upsell: "You added 10 new ACs this year. Let's include them in the renewed AMC for ₹X more."

**Result:** You increase renewal rate from 60% to 85-90% and capture upsell opportunities.

---

## **Money Leak #8: Reactive (Not Proactive) Maintenance**

### **The Problem:**
Your AMC includes 4 preventive maintenance visits/year.

**But during PM, your technician:**
- Cleans the AC filter
- Checks refrigerant level
- Leaves

**What they DON'T do:**
- Notice the compressor is making unusual noise (will fail in 2 months)
- Check for refrigerant leaks (slow leak will cause breakdown)
- Test electrical connections (loose wire will trip circuit breaker)

**Result:** 2 months later, the compressor fails. Customer calls for emergency service.

**You now spend:**
- ₹18,000 on compressor replacement (covered under AMC? Or chargeable? Customer argues it should be covered.)
- 4 hours on emergency visit (vs. 1 hour planned PM)

**Your AMC margin just evaporated.**

### **The Fix:**

**Step 1: Use checklists for PM visits**

Give technicians a 15-point checklist (not just "clean and go"):

**AC Preventive Maintenance Checklist:**
- ✅ Clean air filter
- ✅ Check refrigerant pressure (normal range: X-Y PSI)
- ✅ Inspect compressor for unusual noise/vibration
- ✅ Test electrical connections (tighten if loose)
- ✅ Check drain pipe for blockage
- ✅ Measure amp draw (should be <X amps)
- ✅ Inspect condenser coil for damage/corrosion
- ✅ Test thermostat accuracy

**Step 2: Flag issues before they become breakdowns**

If checklist reveals:
- Refrigerant pressure is low → "Likely slow leak. Recommend gas top-up + leak test."
- Compressor making noise → "Compressor nearing end of life. Recommend replacement in next 60 days."

**Send customer a PM report:**
"During today's maintenance, we identified 2 issues:
1. Low refrigerant (needs top-up: ₹2,500)
2. Compressor showing early failure signs (replacement: ₹18,000)

Recommend addressing now to avoid emergency breakdown."

**Step 3: Upsell predictive maintenance**

Offer **Premium AMC tier** with:
- IoT sensors on critical equipment (monitors temp, vibration, power draw)
- Alerts when parameters go outside normal range
- Replace parts *before* they fail

**Result:** You reduce emergency breakdowns by 50-60%, protect AMC margins, and upsell premium services.

---

## **Money Leak #9: Poor Data Visibility (Flying Blind)**

### **The Problem:**
You manage 50 AMC contracts.

**Quick: Which AMC is most profitable? Which is losing money?**

If you can't answer in 10 seconds, you're flying blind.

**Without data, you:**
- Keep renewing loss-making contracts (because "it's revenue")
- Don't know which customers abuse AMC with excessive breakdown calls
- Can't identify which technicians are most efficient

**Example:** A fire & safety AMC vendor analyzed their contracts and discovered:
- 3 out of 20 AMCs were **losing money** (high breakdown frequency + low pricing)
- 1 client accounted for 40% of all breakdown visits (abusing AMC)

**They renegotiated pricing on the 3 loss-makers and added a "max 6 visits/year" cap on the abusive client. Profit margin jumped from 15% to 29%.**

### **The Fix:**

**Step 1: Track AMC profitability per client**

For each AMC, measure:
- **Contract value** (revenue)
- **Actual cost:** (PM visits + breakdown visits + parts + travel) × cost per hour
- **Profit margin:** (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue × 100

**Example:**

| **Client** | **AMC Value** | **Actual Cost** | **Margin** |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| Client A | ₹1,20,000 | ₹85,000 | 29% ✅ |
| Client B | ₹80,000 | ₹92,000 | -15% ❌ |
| Client C | ₹2,50,000 | ₹1,60,000 | 36% ✅ |

**Client B is losing money!** Renegotiate or exit.

**Step 2: Track visit frequency**

| **Client** | **Planned PM Visits** | **Actual Visits (PM + Breakdown)** | **Variance** |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| Client A | 12 | 14 | +2 (acceptable) |
| Client B | 12 | 28 | +16 (red flag!) |

**Client B is abusing AMC.** Add a visit cap or charge per breakdown after X visits.

**Step 3: Dashboards for real-time visibility**

Use FSM software to create dashboards:
- **AMC Profitability:** See all contracts sorted by margin
- **Visit Heatmap:** Identify clients with excessive breakdown calls
- **Technician Efficiency:** Who completes PM visits fastest? Who has highest first-time fix rate?

**Result:** You make data-driven decisions (renew/renegotiate/exit contracts) instead of gut feelings.

---

## **Money Leak #10: No Asset Tracking Across Multi-Site AMCs**

### **The Problem:**
You have an AMC with a corporate client:
- 5 office locations
- 80 assets total (ACs, UPS, fire systems, elevators)

**Customer calls:** "Our AC in Gurgaon Office, 3rd Floor, Conference Room B is not cooling. Send someone."

**Your coordinator asks:**
- "Which AC? We have 8 ACs on the 3rd floor."
- "When was it last serviced?"
- "Is it under AMC or ad-hoc?"

**Coordinator spends 10 minutes digging through Excel sheets, WhatsApp chats, and old invoices.**

**Technician arrives on-site:** "Which conference room? There are 3 conference rooms on this floor."

**Wasted time: 30 minutes.**

**Across 50 AMC sites, this wastes 15-20 hours/week.**

### **The Fix:**

**Step 1: Create an asset registry**

For every AMC, maintain a digital asset registry:

| **Asset ID** | **Type** | **Client** | **Site** | **Location** | **Serial #** | **Last PM** | **AMC Status** |
|--------------|----------|------------|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| AC-GGN-301 | Split 1.5T | XYZ Corp | Gurgaon | 3F-Conf B | ABC123 | Jan 10 | ✅ Active |
| AC-GGN-302 | Window 1T | XYZ Corp | Gurgaon | 3F-Cabin 5 | ABC124 | Jan 12 | ✅ Active |
| ELEV-GGN-01 | Passenger | XYZ Corp | Gurgaon | Lobby | ELV789 | Dec 20 | ✅ Active |

**Step 2: QR code stickers**

Print QR code stickers for each asset:
- Stick QR code on the AC/equipment
- Technician scans QR code with mobile app
- Instantly sees: Asset history, last PM date, parts used, warranty status

**Step 3: Link jobs to assets (not just clients)**

When scheduling a job:
- Select **Client** → **Site** → **Asset**
- System shows: "Last service: Jan 10. Parts used: Filter (₹200). Notes: Compressor noise noted."

**Technician arrives prepared** (knows the issue history, brings likely spare parts).

**Result:** You save 10-15 hours/week on coordination and reduce repeat visits by 20%.

## Conclusion: Stop the Leaks, Reclaim 10-15% Margin

AMC businesses can be highly profitable—**if managed with data, discipline, and the right tools.**

The 10 profit leaks we covered cost the average AMC vendor **₹3-8 lakhs annually** in lost margins:

1. **Underpricing contracts** → Use cost-based pricing + tiered plans
2. **Untracked spare parts** → Define AMC scope + track parts per job
3. **Missed PM visits** → Auto-schedule recurring jobs + reminders
4. **Inefficient scheduling** → Cluster jobs geographically + route optimization
5. **Scope creep** → Asset registry + out-of-scope billing
6. **Invoicing delays** → Auto-invoices + payment reminders
7. **Lost renewals** → 90/60/30-day renewal alerts + upsell
8. **Reactive maintenance** → PM checklists + predictive alerts
9. **Poor data visibility** → AMC profitability dashboard
10. **No asset tracking** → Multi-site asset registry + QR codes

**If you fix even 5 of these 10 leaks, you can increase your AMC margins from 12-15% to 25-30%.**

**On a ₹50 lakh annual AMC portfolio, that's ₹6-7.5 lakhs of extra profit.**
