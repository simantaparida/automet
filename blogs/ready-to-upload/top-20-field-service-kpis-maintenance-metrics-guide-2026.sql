  $$# Top 20 KPIs for Field Service and Maintenance Teams (2026 Guide)

**"How do I know if my field service team is performing well?"**

If you're managing technicians, coordinating jobs, or overseeing maintenance operations, this question keeps you up at night.

Without clear metrics, you're flying blind:
- Are technicians spending too much time traveling vs. working?
- Why are some jobs completed in 60 minutes while others take 180 minutes?
- Is your preventive maintenance program actually preventing breakdowns?
- Are customers satisfied or just silently planning to switch vendors?

**The answer: Track the right KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).**

In 2026, the best-performing field service companies globally operate on **data-driven decision-making**—not gut feelings or assumptions. They track 15-25 KPIs across technician performance, job quality, maintenance effectiveness, customer experience, and operational efficiency.

**The result?**
- 20-30% higher technician productivity
- 25-40% reduction in repeat visits
- 15-25% lower operational costs
- 30-50% improvement in customer satisfaction

This comprehensive guide covers:
- What field service KPIs are (and why they matter)
- The **20 most important KPIs** to track in 2026
- Formulas, benchmarks, and targets for each metric
- How to use KPIs to improve operations
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Top tools for KPI tracking

Whether you manage 5 technicians or 500, this guide will help you build a metrics-driven field service operation that scales efficiently.

## What Are Field Service KPIs? (Simple Definition)

**Field service KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators) are **measurable metrics that quantify how well your technicians, jobs, maintenance processes, and customer service are performing.**

Unlike vague goals ("improve customer satisfaction"), KPIs are **specific, measurable, and actionable:**
- ❌ Vague: "Technicians should work faster"
- ✅ KPI: "Average job duration: 75 minutes (target: <90 minutes)"

### **5 Main KPI Categories in Field Service:**

1. **Technician Productivity KPIs** - How efficiently are technicians working?
2. **Job Performance KPIs** - Are jobs completed on time and correctly?
3. **Maintenance KPIs** - Is preventive maintenance reducing breakdowns?
4. **Customer Experience KPIs** - Are customers satisfied?
5. **Operational Efficiency KPIs** - Are operations cost-effective?

**Why KPIs matter:** You can't improve what you don't measure. KPIs turn operational chaos into clear, actionable insights.

## Why KPIs Matter for Global Field Service Operations (7 Reasons)

Let's break down why tracking KPIs is essential in 2026:

---

### **1. Improves Technician Productivity**

**Problem:** Some technicians complete 6 jobs/day while others complete 3 (same job types).

**Without KPIs:** You don't know who's efficient, who needs training, or why the gap exists.

**With KPIs:** You track:
- Jobs completed per day (by technician)
- Average job duration (by technician)
- Technician utilization rate (billable hours vs. total hours)

**Result:** You identify top performers (reward them) and struggling technicians (coach them). Average productivity increases 20-30%.

---

### **2. Identifies Bottlenecks in Workflows**

**Problem:** Jobs are taking longer than expected, but you don't know where time is lost.

**Without KPIs:** "Jobs just take a long time" (vague).

**With KPIs:** You break down time:
- Travel time: 45 minutes (40% of total time)
- Waiting for parts: 20 minutes (18%)
- Actual work: 30 minutes (27%)
- Paperwork: 15 minutes (14%)

**Result:** You realize 40% of time is travel → implement route optimization → reduce travel by 30%.

---

### **3. Reduces Operational Cost**

**Problem:** Costs are rising, but you don't know where money is being wasted.

**Without KPIs:** You cut budgets blindly ("everyone do 10% less").

**With KPIs:** You track:
- Cost per job (labor + travel + parts)
- Repeat visit rate (jobs requiring 2+ visits)
- Parts usage vs. budget

**Result:** You identify high-cost jobs (wrong parts inventory → multiple trips), fix root causes, and reduce costs 15-25%.

---

### **4. Improves Customer Satisfaction**

**Problem:** Customer churn is 25%/year, but you don't know why.

**Without KPIs:** "Customers just aren't happy" (not actionable).

**With KPIs:** You track:
- On-time arrival rate (75% → customers complain about delays)
- First-time fix rate (60% → customers frustrated by repeat visits)
- Customer satisfaction score (CSAT: 6.5/10 → below industry average)

**Result:** You improve on-time arrival to 90%, first-time fix to 85%, CSAT to 8.5/10 → churn drops to 10%/year.

---

### **5. Helps Scale Teams Globally**

**Problem:** You're growing from 10 technicians to 50 technicians across 3 cities. Chaos ensues.

**Without KPIs:** You hire more people and hope quality doesn't drop.

**With KPIs:** You establish baseline metrics:
- Jobs per technician per day: 5
- First-time fix rate: 85%
- Technician utilization: 65%

As you scale, you track these KPIs weekly. If new hires are at 3 jobs/day with 60% FTFR, you know they need training.

**Result:** You scale from 10 to 50 technicians while maintaining quality.

---

### **6. Enables Data-Driven Decisions**

**Problem:** You're deciding: "Should we add a 4th preventive maintenance visit per year?"

**Without KPIs:** You guess based on intuition.

**With KPIs:** You analyze:
- Mean time between failures (MTBF): Currently 180 days
- Unplanned maintenance ratio: 40% (too high)
- Jobs triggered by missed PM: 30%

**Result:** Data shows equipment fails every 180 days, and 40% of work is reactive. Adding a 4th PM visit (every 90 days) should reduce unplanned maintenance by 20-30%. You implement, track, and confirm results.

---

### **7. Strengthens Preventive Maintenance Programs**

**Problem:** You run a preventive maintenance program, but breakdowns are still frequent.

**Without KPIs:** "PM doesn't seem to be working" (vague).

**With KPIs:** You track:
- Planned vs. unplanned maintenance ratio: 50/50 (target: 70/30)
- PM completion rate: 75% (target: 95%+)
- Mean time between failures (MTBF): Decreasing (bad sign)

**Result:** You realize 25% of PM visits are being skipped (causing failures). You auto-schedule PM visits, improve completion to 95%, and MTBF increases 40%.

## Top 20 Field Service & Maintenance KPIs (2026 List)

Here are the **20 most important KPIs** every field service manager should track, organized by category:

---

## Category 1: Technician Productivity KPIs

These metrics measure how efficiently your technicians are working.

---

### **KPI #1: First-Time Fix Rate (FTFR)**

**Definition:** Percentage of jobs resolved in the first visit (without requiring a second visit).

**Formula:**
```
FTFR = (Jobs completed in 1 visit / Total jobs) × 100
```

**Example:**
- 85 jobs completed in 1 visit
- 100 total jobs
- FTFR = (85 / 100) × 100 = **85%**

**Target:** 80-90%

**Why it matters:** Low FTFR means wasted time, fuel, and customer frustration. High FTFR indicates technicians arrive prepared with the right parts and skills.

**How to improve:**
- Ensure technicians review asset history before visiting
- Stock vans with common parts
- Improve initial diagnostics (remote troubleshooting before dispatch)
- Train technicians on complex issues

**Red flag:** FTFR <70% → major issue (wrong parts inventory, poor diagnostics, or insufficient training)

---

### **KPI #2: Technician Utilization Rate**

**Definition:** Percentage of time technicians spend on billable work vs. total available work hours.

**Formula:**
```
Utilization Rate = (Billable hours / Total available hours) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Technician works 8 hours/day (40 hours/week)
- Billable work: 26 hours/week (actual on-site job time)
- Non-billable: 14 hours/week (travel, admin, breaks)
- Utilization = (26 / 40) × 100 = **65%**

**Target:** 60-75%

**Why it matters:** Too low (<50%) = wasted capacity. Too high (>80%) = technician burnout.

**How to improve:**
- Reduce travel time (route optimization, geographically cluster jobs)
- Minimize admin work (digital forms instead of paperwork)
- Pre-schedule jobs to avoid idle time

**Industry benchmark:**
- HVAC/plumbing: 60-70%
- IT field service: 50-60%
- Industrial maintenance: 65-75%

---

### **KPI #3: Jobs Completed Per Day**

**Definition:** Average number of jobs a technician completes in one workday.

**Formula:**
```
Jobs/Day = Total jobs completed / Total workdays
```

**Example:**
- 120 jobs completed in a month
- 24 workdays
- Jobs/Day = 120 / 24 = **5 jobs/day**

**Target:** 4-7 jobs/day (varies by industry and job complexity)

**Why it matters:** Direct measure of throughput. Higher = more efficient.

**Factors that affect this KPI:**
- Job complexity (HVAC repair: 1-2 hours; elevator inspection: 4 hours)
- Travel distance (urban: 5-7 jobs/day; rural: 3-4 jobs/day)
- Job clustering (consecutive jobs in same area vs. scattered)

**How to improve:**
- Schedule consecutive jobs in the same geographic zone
- Reduce job duration (better parts inventory, training)
- Minimize gaps between jobs (auto-scheduling)

---

### **KPI #4: Average Job Duration**

**Definition:** Average time from technician check-in to job completion.

**Formula:**
```
Avg Job Duration = Total job hours / Number of jobs
```

**Example:**
- 80 hours spent on jobs in a week
- 20 jobs completed
- Avg Duration = 80 / 20 = **4 hours/job**

**Target:** Varies by job type:
- HVAC repair: 60-90 minutes
- Electrical emergency: 90-120 minutes
- Preventive maintenance: 30-60 minutes
- Complex installations: 3-6 hours

**Why it matters:** Long durations indicate inefficiency, missing parts, or complex issues.

**How to improve:**
- Track duration by job type (not just overall average)
- Identify outliers (why did this PM take 3 hours when average is 45 minutes?)
- Compare technicians (why does Technician A average 60 min while Technician B averages 110 min?)

---

### **KPI #5: Travel Time vs. Work Time Ratio**

**Definition:** Percentage of time spent traveling to jobs vs. actually working on-site.

**Formula:**
```
Travel Ratio = (Travel time / Total time) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Travel time: 3 hours/day
- Work time: 5 hours/day
- Total: 8 hours/day
- Travel Ratio = (3 / 8) × 100 = **37.5%**

**Target:** <30%

**Why it matters:** High travel time = low productivity, high fuel costs.

**How to improve:**
- Geographic job clustering (all jobs in Zone A on Monday, Zone B on Tuesday)
- Route optimization software
- Reduce service radius (focus on profitable zones)

**Industry insight:** Global field service teams in dense urban areas achieve 20-25% travel time. Rural teams: 35-45%.

---

## Category 2: Job Performance KPIs

These metrics measure the quality and timeliness of job execution.

---

### **KPI #6: On-Time Arrival Rate**

**Definition:** Percentage of jobs where the technician arrives within the scheduled time window.

**Formula:**
```
On-Time Rate = (Jobs arrived on time / Total jobs) × 100
```

**Example:**
- 90 jobs where technician arrived within ±15 minutes of scheduled time
- 100 total jobs
- On-Time Rate = (90 / 100) × 100 = **90%**

**Target:** 85-95%

**Why it matters:** Late arrivals frustrate customers and damage reputation.

**How to improve:**
- Build in realistic travel time (use historical data, not Google Maps estimates)
- Send automated alerts to customers if technician is delayed
- Track traffic patterns (avoid scheduling jobs during rush hour)

**Customer impact:** 90%+ on-time arrival correlates with 8.5+/10 customer satisfaction scores.

---

### **KPI #7: SLA Compliance Rate**

**Definition:** Percentage of jobs completed within contractual Service Level Agreement (SLA) timeframes.

**Formula:**
```
SLA Compliance = (Jobs completed within SLA / Total SLA jobs) × 100
```

**Example:**
- SLA: Emergency repairs within 4 hours
- 28 emergency jobs completed within 4 hours
- 30 total emergency jobs
- Compliance = (28 / 30) × 100 = **93.3%**

**Target:** 95%+ (enterprise contracts often require 98-99%)

**Why it matters:** SLA breaches lead to contract penalties, lost renewals, and legal disputes.

**How to improve:**
- Prioritize SLA jobs in dispatch queue
- Maintain on-call technician capacity for emergencies
- Set automated alerts 1 hour before SLA deadline

**Industries with strict SLAs:**
- Elevators (safety-critical: 2-4 hour response)
- Data centers (uptime-critical: 1-2 hour response)
- Medical equipment (health-critical: 4-6 hour response)

---

### **KPI #8: Job Completion Rate**

**Definition:** Percentage of assigned jobs that are completed (vs. canceled, postponed, or abandoned).

**Formula:**
```
Completion Rate = (Jobs completed / Jobs assigned) × 100
```

**Example:**
- 95 jobs completed
- 100 jobs assigned
- 5 jobs canceled (customer unavailable)
- Completion Rate = (95 / 100) × 100 = **95%**

**Target:** 90-95%

**Why it matters:** Low completion rates indicate scheduling issues, customer no-shows, or operational chaos.

**Common reasons for incomplete jobs:**
- Customer unavailable (40%)
- Missing parts (25%)
- Safety issues (15%)
- Technician called to emergency (10%)
- Other (10%)

**How to improve:**
- Send automated appointment reminders 24 hours + 2 hours before job
- Pre-screen jobs to confirm parts availability
- Reschedule (don't cancel) when issues arise

---

### **KPI #9: Repeat Visit Rate**

**Definition:** Percentage of jobs that require a second (or third) visit to fully resolve.

**Formula:**
```
Repeat Visit Rate = (Jobs requiring 2+ visits / Total jobs) × 100
```

**Example:**
- 15 jobs required a repeat visit
- 100 total jobs
- Repeat Rate = (15 / 100) × 100 = **15%**

**Target:** <15% (lower is better)

**Why it matters:** Repeat visits waste time, fuel, and customer patience. High repeat rates indicate poor first-visit preparation or complex issues.

**How to improve:**
- Review asset history before visiting (know what failed before)
- Stock vans with high-use parts
- Improve remote diagnostics (customer sends photo/video before visit)
- Track repeat visit reasons (missing parts? Misdiagnosis? Complex issue?)

**Inverse relationship:** High First-Time Fix Rate (85%) = Low Repeat Visit Rate (15%).

---

### **KPI #10: Average Response Time**

**Definition:** Average time from job assignment to technician dispatch/arrival.

**Formula:**
```
Avg Response Time = Total time to dispatch / Number of jobs
```

**Example:**
- Emergency job assigned at 10:00 AM
- Technician dispatched at 10:15 AM, arrives at 11:00 AM
- Response time: **1 hour**

**Target:**
- Emergency: <2 hours
- Urgent: <24 hours
- Routine: <48 hours

**Why it matters:** Slow response frustrates customers, especially for emergencies.

**How to improve:**
- Real-time technician availability tracking
- Auto-assign jobs to nearest available technician
- Maintain on-call capacity for emergencies

---

## Category 3: Maintenance KPIs

These metrics measure the effectiveness of your preventive and corrective maintenance programs.

---

### **KPI #11: Planned vs. Unplanned Maintenance Ratio**

**Definition:** Percentage of maintenance work that is planned (preventive) vs. unplanned (reactive/emergency).

**Formula:**
```
Planned Ratio = (Planned maintenance jobs / Total maintenance jobs) × 100
```

**Example:**
- 70 planned preventive maintenance jobs
- 30 unplanned emergency breakdowns
- Total: 100 jobs
- Planned Ratio = (70 / 100) × 100 = **70%**

**Target:** 70/30 (planned/unplanned) or better

**Why it matters:** High unplanned ratio (>40%) indicates weak preventive maintenance. Unplanned work is 3-5× more expensive than planned.

**Industry benchmarks:**
- World-class: 80/20 or 85/15
- Average: 60/40
- Reactive (poor): 40/60

**How to improve:**
- Increase PM visit frequency
- Track Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) to identify failure-prone assets
- Auto-schedule PM jobs to ensure they're not skipped

---

### **KPI #12: Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**

**Definition:** Average time between equipment failures (measures asset reliability).

**Formula:**
```
MTBF = Total operational time / Number of failures
```

**Example:**
- Equipment ran for 1,800 hours
- Failed 10 times
- MTBF = 1,800 / 10 = **180 hours**

**Target:** Varies by asset type:
- HVAC: 2,000-3,000 hours
- Elevators: 5,000-8,000 hours
- Manufacturing equipment: 1,500-2,500 hours

**Why it matters:** Higher MTBF = more reliable equipment, fewer breakdowns.

**How to improve:**
- Increase preventive maintenance frequency
- Replace aging assets (MTBF decreasing over time = end of life)
- Track failure patterns (same component failing repeatedly? Upgrade it.)

---

### **KPI #13: Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)**

**Definition:** Average time to repair equipment after a failure occurs.

**Formula:**
```
MTTR = Total repair time / Number of repairs
```

**Example:**
- 50 hours spent on repairs
- 10 repair jobs
- MTTR = 50 / 10 = **5 hours/repair**

**Target:** <4 hours (varies by industry)

**Why it matters:** Lower MTTR = less downtime, happier customers.

**How to improve:**
- Stock critical spare parts on-site or in technician vans
- Train technicians on common repairs
- Use digital asset history (technicians know what worked before)

**Related metric:** MTTR + MTBF = total asset availability.

---

### **KPI #14: Asset Uptime Percentage**

**Definition:** Percentage of time equipment is operational (not broken or under repair).

**Formula:**
```
Uptime % = (Total time - Downtime) / Total time × 100
```

**Example:**
- 30-day month = 720 hours total
- Equipment downtime: 20 hours (repairs)
- Uptime = (720 - 20) / 720 × 100 = **97.2%**

**Target:** 95-99% (varies by industry)

**Why it matters:** Critical for industries where downtime costs money (manufacturing, data centers, elevators).

**Industry benchmarks:**
- Manufacturing: 85-95% (world-class: 98%+)
- Elevators: 98-99.5%
- HVAC (commercial): 95-98%

**How to improve:**
- Reduce MTTR (faster repairs)
- Increase MTBF (fewer failures)
- Improve PM program (catch issues before they cause downtime)

---

### **KPI #15: Maintenance Backlog**

**Definition:** Number of outstanding work orders (jobs assigned but not yet completed).

**Formula:**
```
Backlog (days) = Outstanding work orders / Avg jobs completed per day
```

**Example:**
- 60 outstanding work orders
- Team completes 20 jobs/day on average
- Backlog = 60 / 20 = **3 days**

**Target:** <7 days

**Why it matters:** Growing backlog indicates insufficient capacity or inefficiency.

**How to improve:**
- Hire more technicians (if backlog consistently >10 days)
- Improve technician productivity (increase jobs/day)
- Prioritize critical vs. low-priority jobs

**Red flag:** Backlog growing week-over-week = operations are falling behind.

---

## Category 4: Customer Experience KPIs

These metrics measure how satisfied customers are with your service.

---

### **KPI #16: Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**

**Definition:** Average customer rating of service quality (usually 1-5 or 1-10 scale).

**Formula:**
```
CSAT = Sum of all ratings / Number of responses
```

**Example:**
- 50 customer ratings
- Sum: 425
- CSAT = 425 / 50 = **8.5/10**

**Target:** 8.0+/10 or 4.0+/5

**Why it matters:** Low CSAT = customer churn. High CSAT = renewals, referrals, and brand loyalty.

**How to collect:**
- Automated post-job survey via SMS/email
- Simple question: "How satisfied were you with today's service? Rate 1-10."

**How to improve:**
- Track by technician (identify low performers)
- Review negative ratings (<7/10) and address issues
- Improve on-time arrival, first-time fix rate, and communication

---

### **KPI #17: Net Promoter Score (NPS)**

**Definition:** Measures customer loyalty by asking: "How likely are you to recommend us to a friend?" (0-10 scale).

**Formula:**
```
NPS = % Promoters (9-10 ratings) - % Detractors (0-6 ratings)
```

**Example:**
- 100 responses
- 60 Promoters (9-10)
- 10 Detractors (0-6)
- 30 Passives (7-8, not counted)
- NPS = 60% - 10% = **+50**

**Target:** +30 to +50 (world-class: +70)

**Why it matters:** NPS predicts growth. High NPS = customers actively refer you. Low NPS (<0) = customers warn others away.

**Industry benchmarks:**
- HVAC/plumbing: +30 to +50
- IT field service: +20 to +40
- Industrial maintenance: +40 to +60

**How to improve:**
- Improve CSAT first (NPS follows CSAT)
- Actively request referrals from Promoters
- Address Detractor feedback immediately

---

### **KPI #18: Service Quality Score**

**Definition:** Internal quality audit score based on checklist compliance, proof of work, and supervisor reviews.

**Formula:**
```
Quality Score = (Points earned / Total possible points) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Supervisor audits 10 completed jobs
- Each job scored on 10-point checklist
- Total possible: 100 points
- Actual: 87 points
- Quality Score = (87 / 100) × 100 = **87%**

**Target:** 90%+

**Why it matters:** Ensures consistency and catches quality issues before customers complain.

**Quality checklist items:**
- All photos uploaded (before/after)?
- Checklist 100% completed?
- Customer signature captured?
- Parts documented correctly?
- Notes clear and detailed?

**How to improve:**
- Make proof-of-work mandatory (job can't close without photos)
- Regular quality audits (10% of jobs reviewed weekly)
- Technician feedback loops (share audit results)

---

## Category 5: Operational Efficiency KPIs

These metrics measure cost-effectiveness and process efficiency.

---

### **KPI #19: Cost Per Job**

**Definition:** Average total cost (labor + travel + parts) to complete one job.

**Formula:**
```
Cost Per Job = (Total labor cost + Travel cost + Parts cost) / Number of jobs
```

**Example:**
- 100 jobs completed in a month
- Labor: ₹2,00,000
- Travel: ₹40,000
- Parts: ₹60,000
- Total: ₹3,00,000
- Cost Per Job = ₹3,00,000 / 100 = **₹3,000/job**

**Target:** Varies by industry (HVAC: ₹2,000-₹4,000; industrial: ₹5,000-₹10,000)

**Why it matters:** If you're charging ₹4,000/job but cost is ₹5,000, you're losing money.

**How to improve:**
- Reduce repeat visits (lower labor + travel costs)
- Optimize routes (lower fuel costs)
- Negotiate bulk parts pricing (lower parts costs)
- Improve first-time fix rate (fewer wasted trips)

**Related:** Track Cost Per Job by job type (PM vs. emergency vs. installation) to identify unprofitable work.

---

### **KPI #20: Technician Compliance Rate**

**Definition:** Percentage of jobs where technicians completed all required steps (checklist, proof, documentation).

**Formula:**
```
Compliance Rate = (Jobs with 100% compliance / Total jobs) × 100
```

**Example:**
- 90 jobs with all checklists completed, photos uploaded, parts documented
- 100 total jobs
- Compliance Rate = (90 / 100) × 100 = **90%**

**Target:** 95%+

**Why it matters:** Low compliance = incomplete data, compliance risks, quality issues.

**How to improve:**
- Make compliance mandatory (job can't close until proof uploaded)
- Automated reminders ("You haven't uploaded before/after photos")
- Track by technician (identify non-compliant technicians, provide training)

---

## How to Use KPIs to Improve Field Service Operations (6 Steps)

Tracking KPIs is only valuable if you **act on the data.** Here's how:

---

### **1. Set Weekly & Monthly Targets**

**Don't just track—set goals:**

| **KPI** | **Current** | **Target (30 days)** | **Target (90 days)** |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| First-Time Fix Rate | 75% | 80% | 85% |
| Jobs Per Day | 4.2 | 4.5 | 5.0 |
| On-Time Arrival | 82% | 88% | 92% |
| Customer Satisfaction | 7.8/10 | 8.2/10 | 8.5/10 |

**Review targets monthly.** Adjust based on what's realistic.

---

### **2. Review Dashboards Daily**

**Don't wait for monthly reports.** Check key metrics daily:
- Yesterday's jobs completed
- On-time arrival rate (last 7 days)
- Current backlog
- Technician utilization (week to date)

**15 minutes/day** reviewing dashboards prevents small issues from becoming big problems.

---

### **3. Identify Underperforming Sites/Teams**

**Use KPIs to spot patterns:**

**Example:**
- Site A (corporate office): FTFR 90%, CSAT 9.0/10
- Site B (warehouse): FTFR 60%, CSAT 6.5/10

**Question:** Why is Site B underperforming?

**Investigation:**
- Review asset history: Equipment at Site B is older (15 years vs. 5 years at Site A)
- Review parts usage: Site B jobs require 2× more parts (aging equipment)
- Review technician notes: Site B has poor access (locked gates, no on-site contact)

**Action:**
- Recommend equipment upgrades to customer
- Improve site access coordination
- Stock technician van with Site B-specific parts

**Result:** FTFR at Site B improves from 60% → 78% over 3 months.

---

### **4. Provide Technician Feedback Loops**

**Share KPIs with technicians (not just managers).**

**Monthly 1-on-1 with each technician:**
- "Your FTFR this month: 82% (team average: 85%). What's causing repeat visits?"
- "Your jobs/day: 5.2 (top performer: 6.1). How can we help you improve?"
- "Your CSAT: 9.2/10 (excellent!). Keep it up."

**Positive feedback + data-driven coaching = continuous improvement.**

---

### **5. Automate Reports**

**Don't waste hours creating manual reports in Excel.**

Use FSM software to auto-generate:
- Weekly summary email: Top KPIs, trends, red flags
- Monthly executive report: Full KPI dashboard with charts
- Real-time alerts: "SLA deadline in 30 minutes," "Backlog >10 days," "Technician A missed 3rd check-in today"

---

### **6. Track Trends Instead of Isolated Numbers**

**One bad day doesn't mean failure. Track trends:**

**Example:**
- Week 1: FTFR 78%
- Week 2: FTFR 82%
- Week 3: FTFR 85%
- Week 4: FTFR 88%

**Trend:** ✅ Improving (good sign)

**vs.**

- Week 1: FTFR 85%
- Week 2: FTFR 82%
- Week 3: FTFR 78%
- Week 4: FTFR 75%

**Trend:** ❌ Declining (investigate immediately)

**Use 4-week rolling averages** to smooth out daily/weekly noise.

### **Mistake 1: Tracking Too Many KPIs**

**Problem:** Tracking 50+ KPIs leads to analysis paralysis. No one knows what to focus on.

**Solution:** Start with **5-10 core KPIs.** Once you master those, add more.

**Recommended starter KPIs:**
1. First-Time Fix Rate
2. Technician Utilization
3. On-Time Arrival Rate
4. Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)
5. Cost Per Job

---

### **Mistake 2: Ignoring Technician-Level Insights**

**Problem:** You track team averages (FTFR: 80%) but not individual performance.

**Solution:** Track KPIs **by technician.** Identify top performers (reward/promote) and struggling technicians (coach/train).

**Example:**
- Team FTFR: 80%
- Technician A: 92%
- Technician B: 85%
- Technician C: 65% ← Needs training

---

### **Mistake 3: No Real-Time Visibility**

**Problem:** You review KPIs once a month. By then, issues are weeks old.

**Solution:** Use dashboards with **real-time or daily updates.** Catch issues within 24-48 hours.

---

### **Mistake 4: Missing Proof-of-Work Data**

**Problem:** KPIs are estimates ("I think FTFR is around 80%") because technicians don't document work.

**Solution:** Make **proof of work mandatory** (photos, GPS, checklists). Without proof, KPIs are guesses.

---

### **Mistake 5: Using Spreadsheets Instead of Automated Dashboards**

**Problem:** You manually update Excel sheets weekly. Data is outdated and error-prone.

**Solution:** Use **FSM software** that auto-calculates KPIs from job data.

---

### **Mistake 6: Not Linking KPIs to Preventive Maintenance**

**Problem:** You track PM completion rate but don't connect it to outcomes (MTBF, unplanned maintenance ratio).

**Solution:** Track **PM impact:**
- Before PM program: Unplanned maintenance 60%, MTBF 120 days
- After PM program (6 months): Unplanned maintenance 35%, MTBF 220 days

**Proof:** PM is working.

---

### **Mistake 7: No Field Team Feedback**

**Problem:** You set KPI targets in the office without asking technicians if they're realistic.

**Solution:** Involve technicians in target-setting. Ask: "What's a realistic jobs/day target given our current routes and job types?"

**Result:** Buy-in from the team, realistic targets, shared accountability.
